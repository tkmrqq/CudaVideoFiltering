# Dependencies
```FFMPEG binaries and headers```
```STB Header Libs```
```Video_Codec_SDK_13.0.19``` - NVIDIA VIDEO CODEC SDK

Put libs in /src directory

dir /videos - for input and output videos

# Support format mp4 and .h264 codec

Use Cmake Tools no build 

Building with MSVC compiler, for CUDA you will also need CUDA SDK to run .cu files and have libs like `cuda.h` and `cuda_runtime.h`

Good luck!
